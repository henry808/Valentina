# Art Description from Anton Chigurh's Perspective:

Anton Chigurh, the enigmatic hitman from Cormac McCarthy's "No Country for Old Men", has a bleak and deterministic view of the world, where fate and chance decide outcomes and human agency is often an illusion.

# Title: "Coin Toss of Destiny".

The canvas is split in two. On one half, dark and chaotic swirls of blacks and greys symbolize the unpredictable nature of life and the relentless march of fate. Intermingled are bursts of red, representing the sporadic yet inevitable violence that punctuates existence.

The other half is structured and rigid, filled with golds and silvers, emulating the shine of a coin. This half represents the illusion of control, the belief that we can influence our destiny. The coin, symbolic of Chigurh's infamous decision-making method, is at the center of the chaos and order, showing that both outcomes are just two sides of the same coin.
